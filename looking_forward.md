# Next Steps after ENGL 1650 - Introduction to Digital Humanities

I initially took this class as I had believed we would be scraping data from the internet to work on our projects. This was not the direction that the class went, however, I was not disatisfied. 
I do not believe that I will be taking anymore classes in Digital Humanities as I am a senior and do not have a vested interest in the topic. However, I am appreciative to know of its existence and 
happy to have had the opportunity to experience what it is like to work on projects in this space. I have a new appreciation for the process that is often not seen that allows me to interact with 
digital libraries and archived databases.

I will be taking the following steps to bring some of the work we’ve done together into my future learning: 

- *Interacting with more DH Projects:* This course showed me the availability if many resources at Penn and within the greater academic community that I did not know was available to the public. This includes historic data from the 
Caribbean and the Digital Humanities Department of the University of the West Indies. This was meaningful to know as I am now curious about what projects are being worked on there and will
try to keep up with the projects that they are producing. This is of interest to me because I think growing up in the Caribbean, though you learn history in school unless you study caribbean history
there are a lot of gaps that you will have in historic events. We looked at several projects involving places of my ethnic background Jamaica and bermuda which I did not know there was a space for. Moving 
on from this class I believe that I have the tools necessary to try to find similar digital humanities projects to continue to learn more about my heritage. 

- *Being Mindful of metadata and representation:* One transferable skill that I believe I will be leaving the class with is thinking about metadata and how you want to represent information. I think regardless of what career you go in the 
ability to organize data and labels to data while being cognizant of its intended use and auddience is helpful. In my case, this coud be in regards to how I will leave comments in my projects 
and readmes.

- *Using New Tools for Data Visualization:* In the future, it is likely that I will be giving presentations. Before this project, I did not think of how both quantitative and qualitative data could be 
represented using fabrication, emboidary, 3D scanning and printing etc. Now that I have come to understand the importance of tangibility in representing data, the next time I have a project
I will be sure to consider if there are any benefits to my data being represented in this way.
