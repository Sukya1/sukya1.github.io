## Reflection and Insights Grained From Experience

Three months ago, Digital Humanities was not a course of study that I was familiar with. I did not have alot of expectations coming into the class. I thought the class would use some text mining and other techniques to retrieve and analyze data from text. I am not exactly sure why I thought this would be covered in thec class. I infered that the class would be focused on digitizing data after processing it. I believe that the class met some of my expectations as we did learn new methods of visualizing and digitizing data. Before taking the class, I had not had experience with or thought of using 3D printing and scanning, emboidory or fabrication as a way to visualize data. I also had the opportunity to see what different DH projects could look like. This was my first time seeing projects of this type and it allowed me to think about the ethics around displaying information about individuals who do not have a say in how they are being represented in a project. I had also not considered that you could create projects on the internet that have an intended audience and is explicit this on the website. This was seen in the [Unmapping the Caribbean: Sanctuary and Sound](https://nyuds.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=489f1aee6b324a75b709d5d37f0cea2a) Digital Humanities project that we reviewed in class. This project explicitly stated that it was intnented for individuals and rooted in the Caribbean and their allies. Users were encouraged not to proceed if they did not meet this criteria. The project went on to display audio clips that said "this map is for you" in different Caribbean dialects. At first, I did not understand the logic of this even as a native speaker of Patois, one of the dialects that was displayed on the page. However, after some thought I realized that there could be some valid reason why there was an intended audience. This could include that the writter wants their work to be interacted with by people who are connected to the work that they are doing and will have a stronger sense of appreciation when they engage with the project. It could also mean that they did not want these dialects to be mimics or ridiculed in a way that is offensive to native speakers. After completing the course, I have found that while I am not interested in working in the Digital Humanities space, I do have a new appreciation for these projects and enjoy exploring the data that they present. I did not think that I was the type of person to be interested in exploring data but I think the creative methods of dta visualization that is often used has drawn me to explore these projects. Coming into the class, I had some experience working with minimal computing and markdown class but this class has shown me that it is more useful than I thought and I hope to use it more in the future for my smaller projects. 

Throughout the course, I had the opportunity to work on two projects. For each project, I tried to tell a story with my work. For the printing in prisons workshop, I tried to depict a picture of the 

Here is a list of some the work that I was able to achieve in this course:
